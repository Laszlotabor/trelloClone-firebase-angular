    <p class="entry-body">
      Today I finalized the chat layout: scrollable messages, pinned input, and author emails. I also fixed Firebase rules so everything loads safely. Feels solid now!

  <h3 class="entry-title">Unread Message Indicator</h3>
  <p class="entry-body">
    Added a red dot to cards with unread messages by comparing message and view timestamps per user. Automatically marks chats as read after sending to avoid false alerts — a subtle but powerful boost to collaboration clarity.

  <h3 class="entry-title">Message Detail Modal</h3>
  <p class="entry-body">
    Implemented a centered, modal-style detail view for chat messages with support for editing and deleting own messages. Also added an "Add Image" button as a future enhancement hook — laying the groundwork for rich message content.

  <h3 class="entry-title">Multiple Image Upload Support</h3>
  <p class="entry-body">
    Refactored the card model and upload logic to support multiple images. Integrated a Bootstrap carousel in the detail view and ensured old single-image entries still display correctly via a fallback.

  <h3 class="entry-title">Fixed DB Permission Error & Added User-Specific Chat Colors</h3>
  <p class="entry-body">
    Resolved a <code>PERMISSION_DENIED</code> error during user profile creation in Firebase Realtime Database by updating security rules to scope read/write access by authenticated UID. Refactored the auth service to include a <code>saveUserProfile()</code> helper that waits for Firebase to confirm session authentication before writing. Additionally, implemented dynamic chat bubble coloring by hashing user emails into unique HSL values, allowing each user's messages to appear in consistent pastel tones for clearer conversation context.
